# Fish Face Identification with Siamese Networks

Final project for IKT450-G Deep Neural Networks

requirements:
1. Pytorch
2. Dataset must have each class in its own folder. I made a small python file called `makedirectories.py` which is located inside `data/wrasse`


### This project is largely based on harveyslash's siamese network on AT&T face dataset.
