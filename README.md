# Fish Face Identification with Siamese Networks

Final project for IKT450-G Deep Neural Networks

Requirements:
1. Pytorch
2. Dataset must have each class in its own folder. I made a small python file called `makedirectories.py` which is located inside `data`


### This project is largely based on harveyslash's siamese network on AT&T face dataset.

And his article: https://hackernoon.com/one-shot-learning-with-siamese-networks-in-pytorch-8ddaab10340e


##### `Git clone` can take a while, because i uploaded the entire image dataset as well so it is runnable without having to download and modify the dataset yourself.
